# Building-Agentic-RAG-with-LlamaIndex

Project | DeepLearning.AI

LlamaIndex, **agentic RAG**, a framework designed to build research agents skilled in **tool use**, **reasoning**, and **decision-making** with your data.

In this course:

Build the simplest form of agentic RAG – a router. Given a query, the router will pick one of two query engines, Q&A or summarization, to execute a query over a single document.

Add tool calling to your router agent where you will use an LLM to not only pick a function to execute but also infer an argument to pass to the function.

Build a **research assistant agent**. Instead of tool calling in a single-shot setting, an agent is able to reason over tools in multiple steps.

Build a **multi-document agent** where you will learn how to extend the research agent to handle multiple documents.

Unlike the standard RAG pipeline—suitable for simple queries across a few documents—this intelligent approach adapts based on initial findings to enhance further data retrieval. You’ll learn to develop an autonomous research agent, enhancing your ability to engage with and analyze your data comprehensively.

You’ll practice building agents capable of intelligently navigating, summarizing, and comparing information across multiple research papers from arXiv. Additionally, you’ll learn how to debug these agents, ensuring you can guide their actions effectively.
